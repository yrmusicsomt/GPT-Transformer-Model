# GPT-Transformer-Model
## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a tiny Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch's nn.Transformer module. The Transformer architecture is the backbone of modern NLP models like GPT, BERT, and T5. The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive and minimal implementation of a Transformer-based model, suitable for learning and experimentation.

## 🚀 Features

📌 Custom Tiny Transformer: Built using nn.Transformer in PyTorch.

🔥 End-to-End Training: Covers data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

📊 Attention Mechanisms: Implements self-attention and positional encoding.

🏗 Scalability: Foundation for larger Transformer-based models.

🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation: Clear breakdown of Transformer components.
